Sprint Review and Retrospective - Final Project

#1
  The easiest way to interperet the user's needs is by analyzing data. By this, I need to look for patterns and identify key things and or   items the user may request. After this is complete, i will then organize them and prioritize the items and requests based on difficulty and level of importance. Perhaps I got a bit ahead of myself but before i can complete these two processes, i would need to gather information by doing interviews, asking detailed questions during the daily scrum, or if i were the product owner, i would ask the stakeholders the detailed questions and find out their preferences and needs. 
    Once i get all this information, we can create the user stories. The user stories will provide the team with the details the stakeholders are looking to achieve, allow the team to focus more on the outcomes instead of the specifications. These stories will also help the transparent communication between the product owner, stakeholders, developers and testers.

  The way to approach developing programs is through the entire process of scrum we learned this course. The importance of continious communication and feedback will be in the top 5 list of priorities. While being able to adapt in an agile way for any changes that occur with the feedback and communication will be how i will incorparate everything i have learned. As well as practicing the scrum ways, i would enjoy to see a kanban as well to help with the visual side of progression. Last, just to have side bars or retrospectives to be able to continue that feedback and communication to see what worked and what didn't.

  To be a good team member, we can re adress the importance of communication and feedback. To be open and transparent and fair with the communication will help me succeed. Also being punctual and available. If a team member or perhaps a stakeholder needs to meet or communication, I will swiftly respond and plan accordingly to set a time to communicate. I will also be ready to adapt to any changes that need to happen immediately as well as provide support to others when and if changes happen for them. When it is all said and done, just be cooperative with the team when we work together as well as provide professional opposing feedback if needed.
