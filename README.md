Sprint Review and Retrospective - Final Project

#1
  The easiest way to interperet the user's needs is by analyzing data. By this, I need to look for patterns and identify key things and or   items the user may request. After this is complete, i will then organize them and prioritize the items and requests based on difficulty and level of importance. Perhaps I got a bit ahead of myself but before i can complete these two processes, i would need to gather information by doing interviews, asking detailed questions during the daily scrum, or if i were the product owner, i would ask the stakeholders the detailed questions and find out their preferences and needs. 
    Once i get all this information, we can create the user stories. The user stories will provide the team with the details the stakeholders are looking to achieve, allow the team to focus more on the outcomes instead of the specifications. These stories will also help the transparent communication between the product owner, stakeholders, developers and testers.
